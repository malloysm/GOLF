# GOLF
Golf game created with Processing (https://processing.org/)

GOLF has 9 unique holes that vary in difficulty and are played from an aerial viewpoint. There is club selection and a power and accuracy meter that requires the correct timing to hit the ball far and straight, otherwise it may hook or slice. Upon reaching the green, the game switches from a "hole view" to a "green view" which allows the player to identify slopes that will affect a putt's trajectory. The scorecard is displayed after completing a round. A start menu contains a guide that can be toggled during gameplay to aid a new player.

All the holes are images designed with Microsoft Paint. The holes were created with a color coded system which the game uses to determine whether the ball is on the green, in the cup, in a bunker, and so on. This allows for easy addition of new holes or for changing of holes. An aesthetic hole can be displayed while the game references the color coded hole behind the scenes, but this is not currently in use.
